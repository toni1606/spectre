# Spectre

Spectre is a SDL based spectrogram computing tool. It accepts OGG files as input, and draws a spectrogram on the screen.

**NOTE**: Spectre is mainly for educational purposes, so it may have bugs, issues or missing features. I do **NOT** plan to continue support after everything I wanted to implement is working.

## Building

To build spectre you need to have make and SDL2 installed. The building process itself is very simple.

1. Create the `bin` and `obj` folders.
2. Run `make` or `make all`.
3. Start the program by running `./bin/main`.

If you want to start the program as soon as it is compiled run `make run`.
